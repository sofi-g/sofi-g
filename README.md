### Hi there! I'm Sofi  👋 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Sofi, currently studying my third year of Computer Science at FaMAF - UNC (Córdoba, Argentina). 
I have used languages like Haskell, C, Python, Scala, SQL in university projects. 
Through self-study I have been building a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies and languages and I'm currently learning ReactJs.
