### Hi there! I'm Sofi  ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Sofi, currently studying my third year of Computer Science at FaMAF - UNC (CÃ³rdoba, Argentina). 
I have used languages like Haskell, C, Python, Scala, MySql, Javascript in university projects. 
Through self-study I have been building a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies and languages.

I'm currently working in a company collaborating with the
migration of an web application to Typescript, ReactJS
and Redux.
